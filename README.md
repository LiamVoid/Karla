# Karla BATchAssistant
A BATch assistant for basic chat and tasks
README/Setup For BATch Assistant Karla,

Distribution 1 - Version 1.4


To use this program to full extent a USB drive labled as the d:/ drive in your computer is required, (As of version 1.3 this is no longer required)
The drive should have a folder in the ROOT labeled "BATchAssistant" this is to be done by you, (As of version 1.3 this is no longer required)
In this folder you must have all provided files with their original names and .bat, .txt and .dat extensions
This program will not remember your name or any personal details - although the games included may do this
The way that the games, calculator, encryptor + more work is that they are external files that need to be
opened by Karla so they NEED to be left the same. You may see other random files or .exe's that form
on your desktop or d:/ drive. 

THE USE OF THIS FILE AS WELL AS OTHER FILES IN THIS PACK IS UP TO YOU! I WILL NOT EXCEPT ANY BLAME FOR DAMAGE
TO YOUR DEVICE OR NETWORK
